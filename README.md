# PRODIGY_DS_03
# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing sentiments in tweets using Python, Pandas, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Leveraging the power of data visualization, we explore patterns, trends, and key insights from a Twitter dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project, 'Twitter Sentiments.csv', contains tweet data with associated labels indicating sentiment polarity (0 for non-negative, 1 for negative).

## Project Structure
- **Loading the Dataset:** The initial step involves loading the dataset using Pandas.
- **Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing includes cleaning tweets by removing special characters, numbers, and short words.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We visualize the most frequent words and hashtags in both positive and negative sentiment tweets using WordClouds.
- **Hashtag Analysis:** Extracting and analyzing the top hashtags from both positive and negative sentiment tweets.

## Code Highlights
- **Text Preprocessing:** Utilizing regular expressions and NLTK for cleaning and processing tweets.
- **WordCloud Visualization:** Creating captivating visualizations of frequent words and hashtags for better understanding.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Extracting valuable insights about sentiment patterns.
